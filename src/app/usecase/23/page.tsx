        <div>
          A company collects a vast amount of feedback across multiple channels,
          including social media, customer surveys, and support tickets. The
          challenge lies in efficiently categorizing this feedback and
          extracting actionable insights to improve products and services, a
          task that traditional manual methods struggle to accomplish due to the
          volume and complexity of the data.
